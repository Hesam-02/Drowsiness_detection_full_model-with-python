Drowsiness Detection with python (With updated versions of libraries)


Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving. To prevent these accidents, we will build a system using OpenCV and Keras that warns the driver when they are drowsy. The purpose of this project is to create a drowsiness detection system that detects when a person's eyes are closed for a few seconds, and this system will warn the driver if drowsiness is detected.
